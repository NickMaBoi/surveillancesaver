This screensaver is a guilty pleasure for voyeurs and privacy advocates alike. Your screen is divided into 4 sections, with each one displaying a live surveillance video feed from a selection of over 600 from around the world. Turn it on and feel like Tony Montana monitoring your Cuban cocaine palace without fear of assassination.
